Able to delete the Vote, worker node successfully.
It did not have impact on the results as the data was showing properly in public IP result page.
After deleting the db pod, data was not refreshing in the result page.
Tried by reloading the page and re-lauching the page, did not solve the problem.
Understood that db was changed and the chagned DB was linked to result pod.
Restarted result pod to re-link the correct db to result page.
Able to veiw the data properly in result page.
